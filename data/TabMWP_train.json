The relative frequency of people who are under 30 years old and prefer a laptop is 0.19.\nDivide 0.19 by 0.46.\n\\frac{0.19}{0.46} = 0.413… ≈ 41%\nSo, there is approximately a 41% chance that a person under 30 years old prefers a laptop.\nNext, find the likelihood that a person 30 years old or over prefers a laptop. The relative frequency of people 30 years old or over is 0.54. The relative frequency of people who are 30 years old or over and prefer a laptop is 0.36.\nDivide 0.36 by 0.54.\n\\frac{0.36}{0.54} = 0.666… ≈ 67%\nSo, there is approximately a 67% chance that a person 30 years old or over prefers a laptop.\nLast, compare the two percentages.
