All of the answer choices discuss how likely it is that people in each age group also prefer flavored water. Find the two likelihoods and compare them.\nStart by finding the likelihood that a person under 40 years old prefers flavored water. The relative frequency of people under 40 years old is 0.39. The relative frequency of people who are under 40 years old and prefer flavored water is 0.13.\nDivide 0.13 by 0.39.\n\\frac{0.13}{0.39} = 0.333… ≈ 33%\nSo, there is approximately a 33% chance that a person under 40 years old prefers flavored water.\nNext, find the likelihood that a person 40 years old or over prefers flavored water. The relative frequency of people 40 years old or over is 0.61. The relative frequency of people who are 40 years old or over and prefer flavored water is 0.42.\nDivide 0.42 by 0.61.\n\\frac{0.42}{0.61} = 0.688… ≈ 69%\nSo, there is a 69% chance that a person 40 years old or over prefers flavored water.\nLast, compare the two percentages. Since 33% is less than 69%, people under 40 years old are less likely to prefer flavored water than people 40 years old or over.",
